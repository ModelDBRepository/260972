This model reports the velocity of a 3micron diameter axon when individual channel properties are temperature sensitive (Q10 1.5, 2, 3, 4).
The **.hoc file will run on its own. It loads the model mechanisms (nrnmech.dll), the Q10 values (q10.txt), and session file (40ms.ses). It inputs the arrival times of the first and second action potential if there is one (arrival_time_and_counter.dat).
